<div class="block"><p>
 Transaction context for atomic units of work performed by Persistit. Each
 Persistit thread typically uses one <code>Transaction</code> object for its
 lifetime. Within that context it may execute and commit many transactions.
 </p>
 <p>
 The application determines when to <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#begin()"><code>begin()</code></a>, <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#commit()"><code>commit()</code></a>,
 <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#rollback()"><code>rollback()</code></a> and <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#end()"><code>end()</code></a> transactions. Once a transaction has
 started, no update operation performed within its context will be visible to
 other threads until <code>commit</code> is performed. At that point, all the
 updates become visible and durable.
 </p>
 <p>
 Persistit implements Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) with <a
 href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_isolation">Snapshot Isolation</a>
 for high concurrency and throughput. This protocol is <i>optimistic</i> in
 that competing concurrent transactions run at full speed without locking, but
 can arrive in a state where not all transactions can be allowed to commit
 while preserving correct semantics. In such cases one or more of the
 transactions must roll back (abort) and retry. These topics are covered in
 greater detail below.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <code>Transaction</code> object itself is not thread-safe and may be
 accessed and used by only one thread at a time. However, the database
 operations being executed within the scope defined by <code>begin</code> and
 <code>end</code> are capable of highly concurrent execution.
 </p>
 <h2>Lexical Scoping</h2>
 <p>
 Applications must manage the scope of any transaction by ensuring that
 whenever the <code>begin</code> method is called, there is a concluding
 invocation of the <code>end</code> method. The <code>commit</code> and
 <code>rollback</code> methods do not end the scope of a transaction; they
 merely signify the transaction's intended outcome when <code>end</code> is
 invoked. Applications should follow either the <a href="#_pattern1">
 <code>try/finally</code></a> or the <a href="#_pattern2">
 <code>TransactionRunnable</code></a> pattern to ensure correctness.
 </p>
 <p>
 <a name="commitPolicy"/>
 <h2>Commit Policy</h2>
 Persistit provides three policies that determine the durability of a
 transaction after it has executed the <code>commit</code> method. These are:
 <dl>
 <dt><a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.CommitPolicy.html#HARD"><code>Transaction.CommitPolicy.HARD</code></a></dt>
 <dd>The <code>commit</code> method does not return until all updates created
 by the transaction have been written to non-volatile storage (e.g., disk
 storage).</dd>
 <dt><a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.CommitPolicy.html#GROUP"><code>Transaction.CommitPolicy.GROUP</code></a></dt>
 <dd>The <code>commit</code> method does not return until all updates created
 by the transaction have been written to non-volatile storage. In addition,
 the committing transaction waits briefly in an attempt to recruit other
 concurrently running transactions to write their updates with the same
 physical I/O operation.</dd>
 <dt><a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.CommitPolicy.html#SOFT"><code>Transaction.CommitPolicy.SOFT</code></a></dt>
 <dd>The <code>commit</code> method returns <i>before</i> the updates have
 been recorded on non-volatile storage. Persistit attempts to write them
 within 100 milliseconds, but this interval is not guaranteed.</dd>
 </dl>
 <p>
 You can specify a default policy in the Persistit initialization properties
 using the <a href="../../com/persistit/Configuration.html#COMMIT_POLICY_PROPERTY_NAME">"txnpolicy"</a>
 property or under program control using
 <a href="../../com/persistit/Persistit.html#setDefaultTransactionCommitPolicy(com.persistit.Transaction.CommitPolicy)"><code>Persistit.setDefaultTransactionCommitPolicy(com.persistit.Transaction.CommitPolicy)</code></a> . The default policy
 applies to the <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#commit()"><code>commit()</code></a> method. You can override the default policy
 using <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#commit(com.persistit.Transaction.CommitPolicy)"><code>commit(CommitPolicy)</code></a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 HARD and GROUP ensure each transaction is written durably to non-volatile
 storage before the <code>commit</code> method returns. The difference is that
 GROUP can improve throughput somewhat when many transactions are running
 concurrently because the average number of I/O operations needed to commit N
 transactions can be smaller than N. However, for one or a small number of
 concurrent threads, GROUP reduces throughput because it works by introducing
 a delay to allow other concurrent transactions to commit within a single I/O
 operation.
 </p>
 <p>
 SOFT commits are generally much faster than HARD or GROUP commits, especially
 for single-threaded applications, because the results of numerous update
 operations can be aggregated and written to disk in a much smaller number of
 I/O operations. However, transactions written with the SOFT commit policy are
 not immediately durable and it is possible that the recovered state of a
 database will be missing transactions that were committed shortly before a
 crash.
 </p>
 <p>
 For SOFT commits, the state of the database after restart is such that for
 any committed transaction T, either all or none of its modifications will be
 present in the recovered database. Further, if a transaction T2 reads or
 updates data that was written by any other transaction T1, and if T2 is
 present in the recovered database, then so is T1. Any transaction that was in
 progress, but had not been committed at the time of the failure, is
 guaranteed not to be present in the recovered database. SOFT commits are
 designed to be durable within 100 milliseconds after the commit returns.
 However, this interval is determined by computing the average duration of
 recent I/O operations to predict the completion time of the I/O that will
 write the transaction to disk, and therefore the interval cannot be
 guaranteed.
 </p>
 <h2>Optimistic Concurrent Scheduling - MVCC</h2>
 <p>
 Persistit schedules concurrently executing transactions optimistically,
 without locking any database records. Instead, Persistit uses a well-known
 protocol called Snapshot Isolation to achieve atomicity and isolation. While
 transactions are modifying data, Persistit maintains multiple versions of
 values being modified. Each version is labeled with the commit timestamp of
 the transaction that modified it. Whenever a transaction reads a value that
 has been modified by other transactions, it reads the latest version that was
 committed before its own start timestamp. In other words, all read operations
 are performed as if from a "snapshot" of the state of the database made at
 the transaction's start timestamp - hence the name "Snapshot Isolation."
 </p>
 <h3>Pruning</h3>
 <p>
 Given that all updates written through transactions are created as versions
 within the MVCC scheme, a large number of versions can accumulate over time.
 Persistit reduces this number through an activity called "version pruning."
 Pruning resolves the final state of each version by removing any versions
 created by aborted transactions and removing obsolete versions no longer
 needed by currently executing transactions. If a value contains only one
 version and the commit timestamp of the transaction that created it is before
 the start of any currently running transaction, that value is called
 <i>primordial</i>. The goal of pruning is to reduce almost all values in a
 Persistit Tree to their primordial states because updating and reading
 primordial values is more efficient than the handling required for multiple
 version values. Pruning happens automatically and is generally not visible to
 the application.
 </p>
 <h3>Rollbacks</h3>
 <p>
 Usually Snapshot Isolation allows concurrent transactions to commit without
 interference but this is not always the case. Two concurrent transactions
 that attempt to modify the same Persistit key-value pair before committing
 are said to have a "write-write dependency". To avoid anomalous results one
 of them must abort, rolling back any other updates it may have created, and
 retry. Persistit implements a "first updater wins" policy in which if two
 transactions attempt to update the same record, the first transaction "wins"
 by being allowed to continue, while the second transaction "loses" and is
 required to abort.
 </p>
 <p>
 Once a transaction has aborted, any subsequent database operation it attempts
 throws a <a href="../../com/persistit/exception/RollbackException.html" title="class in com.persistit.exception"><code>RollbackException</code></a>. Application code should generally catch
 and handle the <code>RollbackException</code>. Usually the correct and
 desired behavior is simply to retry the transaction. See <a
 href="#_pattern1"><code>try/finally</code></a> for a code pattern that
 accomplishes this.
 </p>
 <p>
 A transaction can also voluntarily roll back. For example, transaction logic
 could detect an error condition that it chooses to handle by throwing an
 exception back to the application. In this case the transaction should invoke
 the <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#rollback()"><code>rollback()</code></a> method to explicit declare its intent to abort the
 transaction.
 </p>
 <h3>Read-Only Transactions</h3>
 <p>
 Under Snapshot Isolation, transactions that read but do not modify data
 cannot generate any write-write dependencies and are therefore not subject to
 being rolled back because of the actions of other transactions. However, note
 that even if it modifies no data, a long-running transaction can force
 Persistit to retain old value versions for its duration in order to provide a
 snapshot view. This behavior can cause congestion and performance degradation
 by preventing very old values from being pruned. The degree to which this is
 a problem depends on the volume of update transactions being processed and
 the duration of long-running transactions.
 </p>
 
 <a name="_pattern1"/> <h2>The try/finally/retry Code Pattern</h2>
 <p>
 The following code fragment illustrates a transaction executed with up to to
 RETRY_COUNT retries. If the <code>commit</code> method succeeds, the whole
 transaction is completed and the retry loop terminates. If after RETRY_COUNT
 retries <code>commit</code> has not been successfully completed, the
 application throws a <code>TransactionFailedException</code>.
 </p>
 
 <blockquote><code><pre>
     Transaction txn = Persistit.getTransaction();
     int remainingAttempts = RETRY_COUNT;
     for (;;) {
         txn.begin();         // Begin transaction scope
         try {
             //
             // ...perform Persistit fetch, remove and store operations...
             //
             txn.commit();     // attempt to commit the updates
             break;            // Exit retry loop
         }
         catch (RollbackException re) {
             if (--remainingAttempts &lt; 0) {
                 throw new TransactionFailedException(); 
             {
         }
         finally {
             txn.end();       // End transaction scope. Implicitly 
                              // roll back all updates unless
                              // commit completed successfully.
         }
     }
 </pre></code></blockquote>
 
 <a name="_pattern2" /> <h2>The TransactionRunnable Pattern</h2>
 <p>
 As an alternative, the application can embed the actual database operations
 within a <a href="../../com/persistit/TransactionRunnable.html" title="interface in com.persistit"><code>TransactionRunnable</code></a> and invoke the <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#run(com.persistit.TransactionRunnable)"><code>run(com.persistit.TransactionRunnable)</code></a> method to
 execute it. The retry logic detailed in the fragment shown above is handled
 automatically by <code>run</code>; it could be rewritten as follows:
 
 <blockquote><code><pre>
     Transaction txn = Persistit.getTransaction();
     txn.run(new TransactionRunnable() {
         public void runTransaction()
         throws PersistitException, RollbackException {
             //
             //...perform Persistit fetch, remove and store operations...
             //
         }
     }, RETRY_COUNT, 0);
 </pre></code></blockquote>
 
 </p>
 <a name="_scopedCodePattern"/> <h2>Nested Transaction Scope</h2>
 <p>
 Persistit supports nested transactions by counting the number of nested
 <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#begin()"><code>begin()</code></a> and <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#end()"><code>end()</code></a> operations. Each invocation of
 <code>begin</code> increments this count and each invocation of
 <code>end</code> decrements the count. These methods are intended to be used
 in a standard essential pattern, shown here, to ensure that the scope of of
 the transaction is reliably determined by the lexical the structure of the
 code rather than conditional logic: <blockquote><code><pre>
     <b>txn.begin();</b>
     try {
         //
         // Application transaction logic here, possibly including 
         // invocation of methods that also call txn.begin() and
         // txn.end().
         //
         <b>txn.commit();</b>
     } finally {
         <b>txn.end();</b>
     }
 </pre></code></blockquote>
 </p>
 <p>
 This pattern ensures that the transaction scope is ended properly regardless
 of whether the application code throws an exception or completes and commits
 normally.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#commit()"><code>commit()</code></a> method performs the actual commit operation only when the
 current nested level count (see <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#getNestedTransactionDepth()"><code>getNestedTransactionDepth()</code></a>) is 1.
 That is, if <code>begin</code> has been invoked N times, then
 <code>commit</code> will actually commit the data only when <code>end</code>
 is invoked the Nth time. Data updated by an inner (nested) transaction is
 never actually committed until the outermost <code>commit</code> is called.
 This permits transactional code to invoke other code (possibly an opaque
 library supplied by a third party) that may itself <code>begin</code> and
 <code>commit</code> transactions.
 </p>
 <p>
 Invoking <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#rollback()"><code>rollback()</code></a> removes all pending but uncommitted updates and
 marks the current transaction scope as <i>rollback pending</i>. Any
 subsequent attempt to perform any Persistit operation, including
 <code>commit</code> in the current transaction scope, will fail with a
 <code>RollbackException</code>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Application developers should beware that the <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#end()"><code>end()</code></a> method performs an
 implicit rollback if <code>commit</code> has not completed. Therefore, if an
 application fails to call <code>commit</code>, the transaction will silently
 fail. The <code>end</code> method sends a warning message to the log
 subsystem when this happens, but does not throw an exception. The
 <code>end</code> method is designed this way to allow an exception thrown
 within the application code to be caught and handled without being obscured
 by a RollbackException thrown by <code>end</code>. But as a consequence,
 developers must carefully verify that the <code>end</code> method is always
 invoked whether or not the transaction completes normally.
 </p>
 <h2>Step Index: Controlling Visibility of Uncommitted Updates</h2>
 <p>
 By default, application logic within the scope of a transaction can read two
 kinds of values: those that were committed by other transactions prior to the
 start of the current transaction (from the "snapshot") and those that were
 modified by the transaction itself. However, in some applications it is
 useful to control the visibility of modifications made by the current
 transaction. For example, update queries that select records to update and
 then change the very values used as selection criteria can produce anomalous
 results. See <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_Problem">Halloween Problem</a>
 for a succinct description of this issue. Persistit provides a mechanism to
 control visibility of a transaction's own modifications to avoid this
 problem.
 </p>
 <p>
 While a transaction is executing, every updated value it generates is stored
 within a multi-version value and labeled with the transaction ID of the
 transaction that produced it <u>and</u> a small integer index (0-99) called
 the <i>step</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 The current step index is an attribute of the <code>Transaction</code> object
 available from <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#getStep()"><code>getStep()</code></a>. The <code>begin</code> method resets its
 value to zero. An application can invoke <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#incrementStep()"><code>incrementStep()</code></a> to increment
 it, or <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#setStep(int)"><code>setStep(int)</code></a> to control its current value. Modifications created
 by the transaction are labeled with the current step value.
 </p>
 <p>
 When reading data, modifications created by the current transaction are
 visible to Persistit if and only if the step number they were assigned is
 less or equal to the <code>Transaction</code>'s current step number. An
 application can take advantage of this by controlling the current step index,
 for example, by reading data using step 0 while posting updates with a step
 value of 1.
 </p>
 <a name="_threadManagement" /> <h2>Thread Management</h2>
 <p>
 As noted above, a <code>Transaction</code> typically belongs to one thread
 for its entire lifetime and is <i>not</i> threadsafe. However, to support
 server applications which may manage a large number of sessions among a
 smaller number of threads, Persisit allows an application to manage sessions
 explicitly. See <a href="../../com/persistit/Persistit.html#getSessionId()"><code>Persistit.getSessionId()</code></a> and
 <a href="../../com/persistit/Persistit.html#setSessionId(com.persistit.SessionId)"><code>Persistit.setSessionId(SessionId)</code></a>. The method
 <a href="../../com/persistit/Persistit.html#getTransaction()"><code>Persistit.getTransaction()</code></a> is sensitive to the thread's current
 <code>SessionId</code>, and therefore the following style of interaction is
 possible:
 <ul>
 <li>Thread T1 is assigned work for session S.</li>
 <li>Thread T1 invokes <code>begin</code>, does some work and then returns
 control to a client.</li>
 <li>Thread T2 receives additional work to perform on behalf of session S.</li>
 <li>Thread T2 sets its current SessionId to session S</li>
 <li>Thread T2 then uses <a href="../../com/persistit/Persistit.html#getTransaction()"><code>Persistit.getTransaction()</code></a> to acquire the
 same transaction context previously started by T1.</li>
 <li>Thread T2 does additional work and then calls <code>commit</code> and
 <code>end</code> to complete the transaction.</li>
 </ul>
 Applications that use this technique must be written carefully to ensure that
 multiple threads never execute with the same SessionId. Concurrent access to
 a <code>Transaction</code> or <code>Exchange</code> can cause serious errors,
 including database corruption.
 </p>
 <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
 <p>
 Optimistic concurrency control works well when the likelihood of conflicting
 transactions - that is, concurrent execution of two or more transactions that
 modify the same database records - is low. For most applications this
 assumption is valid.
 </p>
 <p>
 For best performance, applications in which multiple threads frequently
 operate on overlapping data such that roll-backs are likely, the application
 should implement its own locks to prevent or reduce the likelihood of
 collisions.
 </p>
 <p>
 An application can examine counts of commits, rollbacks and rollbacks since
 the last successful commit using <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#getCommittedTransactionCount()"><code>getCommittedTransactionCount()</code></a>,
 <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#getRolledBackTransactionCount()"><code>getRolledBackTransactionCount()</code></a> and
 <a href="../../com/persistit/Transaction.html#getRolledBackSinceLastCommitCount()"><code>getRolledBackSinceLastCommitCount()</code></a>, respectively.
